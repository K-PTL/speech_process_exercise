from scipy.io import wavfile

IN_WAVE_FILE = "in.wav"       # 入力音声
OUT_WAVE_FILE = "out.wav"     # 分析再合成した音声

# 音声の読み込み
fs, x = wavfile.read(IN_WAVE_FILE)

# 音声の分析 (基本周波数、スペクトル包絡、非周期性指標)
f0, sp, ap = pyworld.wav2world(x, fs)

# 音声の再合成
y = pyworld.synthesize(f0, sp, ap, fs)
y = y.astype(np.int16)

# wavファイルに保存
